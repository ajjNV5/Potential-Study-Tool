We are calculating Technical potential which is replacing every single measure with the most efficient option


Layer - End-use, Building type, Sector(Res, Com)


Table - baseline measure name and it savings per year in kwh
Table - efficient measure name and it savings per year in kwh

Table -  measure savings changes based on building type (scaling factor) (Single family given for res table will be 1 for sf and mf will be .8 depending on the measure) (Make this whole table 1 for now) 

Table - By Building type and measure Feasibility

Table - By Building type and measure Not Complete (Retrofit, Markets)

Table - Market size - (how many of each unit are there) (ex. single family - 1,000)

Table - Market multiplier - (in a single unit how many instances of that measure are installed)


Example:
Electric storage water heater baseline kwh
Efficient heat pump water heater 
Assuming in Retrofit market for simplicity
Water heating end-use (space heating secondary effects ignored)

(baseline_kwh - efficient_kwh) = saved_kwh

saved_kwh*building_type_scaling_factors = new table of savings by building type


Multiply by our market size (Inputs - Customer population from utility (how many single family homes are in to service territory) (Commercial 1000 Sq) 100,000 customers Res | 1,000,000 sq commercial 

Table - Market multiplier - (in a single unit how many instances of that measure are installed) (average single family home in this territory has 1.1 water heaters, Small office 0.3 water heaters per 1000 sq)

Then adjust with the factors - removed saving that are not feasible (Multiply by respective feasibility)
Remove measures that have already been upgraded (Not - Complete factor)

Result is the max amount of energy saved if every measure(from our list) is upgraded.
